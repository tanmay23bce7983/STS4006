# Queue follows FIFO principle
```py
FRONT <-[ A,B,C,D ] -> REAR
```
## Types of queues

- Simple queue (Insertion and Deletion from front)
- Double ended queue (Insertion and Deletion from both sides)
- Priority queue
    - Highest priority sorted
    - Lowest priority sorted

## How can we implement queues

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Binary Search Tree

### Opreations in a queue
- Add element using `enque`
- Remove element using `deque`
- Check top element using `poll`


> If we implement the queue using LinkedList or BST, we can use the operations available in those data structures aswell.
